# Requirement2
To solve this requirement, first I installed app called "Tampermonkey".
This extension helps me check output of Console when I request from my devices to website and the output is an array with elements are links of images in website
For examples, first I need to provide the link of website that I want to take images from web.

Then I check the console, and the output is an array of image links.

In file tool.py, I explain clearly my idea to solve this problem

I have uploaded 1000 images for each folder to my Google Drive. You can access the images using this link:
